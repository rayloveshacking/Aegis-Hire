## Responsible AI Design Principles

The Interview Copilot is built on three core principles:

1. **Transparency**: Every AI decision is explainable and evidence-based
2. **Fairness**: The system actively detects and prevents bias
3. **Human-in-the-Loop**: AI augments, never replaces, human judgment

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to fetch" error
- **Cause**: CORS issue or backend not running
- **Solution**: Ensure backend is running on port 8000 and CORS is configured

### Microphone not working
- **Cause**: Browser permissions or unsupported browser
- **Solution**: Use Chrome/Edge and grant microphone permissions

### Speech recognition not starting
- **Cause**: Web Speech API not available
- **Solution**: Use Google Chrome (recommended) or Microsoft Edge

### WebSocket connection fails
- **Cause**: Backend WebSocket endpoint not accessible
- **Solution**: Check backend logs and ensure `/ws/interview/{session_id}` is accessible

### Email not sending
- **Cause**: SMTP credentials not configured
- **Solution**: Add SMTP settings to `.env` file in backend

## Demo Workflow
